## Workflow

### Employee Creation Process
1. **Admin creates Supabase user** via `POST /api/v1/add-emp`
2. **System returns authUserId** from Supabase
3. **Admin creates complete profile** via `POST /api/v1/employees` using the authUserId
4. **System stores profile locally** and links to Supabase user

### Employee Deletion Process
1. **Admin initiates deletion** via `DELETE /api/v1/employees/:id`
2. **System deletes from local database** first
3. **System deletes from Supabase** Auth
4. **Rollback mechanism** ensures data consistency if any step fails

## Role-Based Access Control

### Admin Role
- Create, read, update, delete all employees
- Access employee statistics
- Full system privileges

### Manager Role
- Read employee information
- Additional permissions for Leave Management and Attendance (future modules)

### Employee Role
- Read own profile information
- Access to employee-specific features

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation
- All inputs validated using Zod schemas
- Date format validation (dd/mm/yyyy)
- Email format validation
- Required field validation
- Custom business logic validation

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token validation on every request
- Role-based middleware protection
- Supabase Admin API for user management
- Secure password handling (managed by Supabase)

### Error Handling
- Structured error responses
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error logging
- No sensitive information in error messages

### Data Consistency
- Atomic operations across systems
- Rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- Audit trails for all changes
- Correlation IDs for request tracking

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed fields for fast queries (supabaseId, email, department, employmentType, isActive)
- Pagination to limit data transfer
- Efficient search queries with proper indexing

### Caching Strategy
- JWT token validation caching (future enhancement)
- Employee statistics caching (future enhancement)
- Connection pooling for database operations

### Scalability
- Stateless design for horizontal scaling
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance
- Separation of concerns between authentication and business logic

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Employee photo upload and management
- Document management system
- Employee onboarding workflow
- Performance review system
- Leave management integration
- Attendance tracking integration
- Notification system
- Bulk employee operations
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Employee self-service portal

### Technical Improvements
- Redis caching layer
- Webhook system for real-time updates
- Advanced audit logging
- Data export functionality
- API rate limiting per user
- Advanced search with Elasticsearch
- Real-time notifications
